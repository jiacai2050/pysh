## PySh

A shell can run on anywhere Python can run.


## Concept

All commands are implmented in Python, which means there is no [differences](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11454/what-is-the-difference-between-a-builtin-command-and-one-that-is-not) bewteen builtins and one that is not.

Supported commands can be found [here](./pysh/builtins).

More commands are on the way. PR welcomed !


### Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/jiacai2050/pysh.git
cd pysh
python -m pysh.shell
```

Have fun ðŸ˜„
